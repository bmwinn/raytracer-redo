Ray Tracer
Bridget Winn

To run:
   create directory for .pov files - "pov"
   create directory for .tga files - "tga"
   run make
   ./raytrace <width> <height> pov/__.pov

Right now, the program is hard-coded to write raytrace.tga to
the tga directory. In the future, you will be able to specify
the name of the result .tga file and destination directory.
