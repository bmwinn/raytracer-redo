* change intersect from (ray, point) to (ray)

* make point xyz public, erase getters and setters
* make vector xyz, magnitude public, erase getters and setters
* Triangle.cpp:   // change to vertexA = *vA; ?
* which things in geometry need to be private?
  -> how can certain things be accessed by geom children but not others?
* Add *light, *camera, and *allGeometry<> to Geometry objs
